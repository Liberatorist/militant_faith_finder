This app scrapes the Path of Exile trading website for Militant Faith Jewels with the modifier 
"1% increased effect of Non-Curse Auras from your skills per 10 devotion", filters out the jewels that would brick the 
usual aurabot's notable passives, i.e. "Foresight", "Thrill Killer", "Destructive Apparatus", "Leadership", "Harrier" or "Reflexes"
and redirects the user to a trade query that contains the cheapest Jewels, that leave these passives intact.
